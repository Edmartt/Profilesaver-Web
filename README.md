If you are Linux User:

1. python3 -m venv yourvirtualenviroment name
2. . yourvirtualenviroment/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. export FLASK_APP=app/
5. export FLASK_ENV=development
6. export FLASK_DEBUG=1
7. flask init-db
8. flask run

If you are  Windows user, the step 2 just change bin folder and it's called Scripts.
Instead export command use set. Those are the only differences.
